# 💼 Salary Analysis with Linear Regression

📊 *Exploratory Data Analysis + Predictive Modeling*

## 🧾 Overview

This project performs a comprehensive salary analysis using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. It combines **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with a **machine learning model** to predict salaries based on job-related features.

Technologies used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn for regression modeling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

Install the necessary Python packages with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

### ▶️ How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook salary_analysis.ipynb
```

Run all cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and model training.

## 📊 Key Sections

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature encoding
- Outlier treatment

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Salary distribution
- Salary by experience, job title, remote work ratio
- Correlation matrix

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- **Model:** Linear Regression
- **Features:** Experience level, company size, remote ratio, job title
- **Target:** Salary
- **Metrics Evaluated:**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

### 4. Visualizations
- Distribution plots
- Boxplots
- Heatmaps
- Regression line plots

## 🧠 Insights

- Senior roles in large companies earn significantly higher salaries.
- Remote work flexibility is correlated with higher pay in some sectors.
- Linear regression provides a baseline for salary prediction, though improvements may be made using advanced models.
